# Operating-Systems

One of the bigger **Programming Projects** I have completed. I made a **_simulated Operating System shell kernel_** with fully functional parts such as a **_User Interface_**, that allows **_variable saving_** and a **_text interpreter_**, but more importantly it simulates classical **_OS functionalities_** such as **_CPU Scheduling,Disk Scheduling, Memory Managing, etc_** by programmed components such as **_cpu,ram, disk, ioscheduler, process control block_** to name a few. Some high level algorithms include **_Round Robin Scheduling, Fragmentation & Disk Swapping, Garbage Collections, Block Allocation Maps_**
