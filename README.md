# Operating-Systems

One of the bigger **Programming Projects** I have completed. I made a **_simulated Operating System shell kernel_** with fully functional parts such as a **_User Interface_**, that allows saving variables, but more importantly it simulates classical **_OS functionalities_** such as **_CPU Scheduling,Disk Scheduling, Memory Allocation_**
